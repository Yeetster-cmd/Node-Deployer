Node-Deployer is a free and mostly automatic bash script that allows the automatic deployment of nodes to the Pterodactyl Nodes.

That's it, just download it, ```chmod +x script.sh``` it and run it ```./script.sh``` Nothing more.

NOTICE: IF YOU ARE BEHIND CLOUDFLARE/ANY PROXY PLEASE ENABLE POST AND GET REQUESTS, OTHERWISE THE SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK (or if know how to code, add a "title"/name to the request, so that you don't have to enable all POST and GET requests)
