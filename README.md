Node-Deployer is a free and mostly automatic bash script that allows the automatic deployment of nodes to the Pterodactyl Nodes.

That's it, just download it, chmod +x script.sh it, sed -i -e 's/\r$//' script.sh it and run it. Nothing more.

NOTICE: IF YOU ARE BEHIND CLOUDFLARE/ANY PROXY PLEASE ENABLE POST AND GET REQUESTS, OTHERWISE THE SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK (or if know how to code, adding a "title"/name to the request, so that you don't have to enable all POST and GET requests)
